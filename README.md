# ARtiSANS : Analytic Re-evaluation of Supernova Axion and Neutrino Streaming
by Ana Luisa Foguel and Eduardo S. Fraga

# Introduction
We present a numerical package to compute the effect of axion nuclear Bremsstrahlung and Primakoff supernova emission on neutrino observables.

# Paper
In our manuscript `Analytic approach to ALP emission in core-collapse supernovae` we provide additional explanations about the analytic computations of neutrino and axion luminosities as well as neutrino average energy in the presence of axion-nucleon Bremsstrahlung and axion-photon Primakoff interactions.

# Tutorial
We provide a tutorial Jupyter notebook `ARtiSANS_tutorial.ipynb`, where one can learn how to use the code.

# Support
In case of any questions or suggestions, please contact afoguel@usp.br .
